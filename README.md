This is The Dog House, a local dog grooming salon in Prestatyn, North Wales. The website will help new and returning users to find useful information about the dog groomers and enable them to contact the groomers to book an appointment or for general enquiries.

The aim of this project is to provide a responsive, easy to use and easy to learn website that is aesthetically pleasing and useful to the users.

HTML and CSS will be the languages used to create this website.

# Design 

## Wireframes

The following wireframes were created during the design process with [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/?gclid=CjwKCAiAhKycBhAQEiwAgf19etPR1ccdA0Aiezm63MsBy4PezCLSlN1T14ubQH1pMB7oa7Hz9YqWHhoC-VEQAvD_BwE).

## Colour
The colour palette was taken from the branding already used by this well established company. This was to ensure brand continuity throughout all their digital and tangible marketing assets.

* Gold #ba9950
* Dark Gold #4a3d20
* White #fff
* Black #000
* Dark Grey #212529

## Typography
The Poppins font from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) is the main font used throughout the site. It is used frequently by many web developers and is easy on the eye. Sans Serif is set as a backup should the Poppins font fail to load.

## Structure
The page is structured in a familiar, user friendly, and easy to learn way. The navigation bar with the shop logo on the left side and the navigation links to the right is a view that users are used to and link to the different sections of the webpage.  The website consists of four sections :
* A home section with a hero image and small description of the business. 
* A section detailing the services offered
* A gallery section with images of previously groomed dogs
* A testimonial section from happy customers
* A footer section containing contact information, opening times and social media links 

# Features

## Header

![The header for the website](/assets/images/header-screenshot.webp "Header")

The header follows a format users will be familiar with. It is fixed to the top of the page so the usercan navigate to different parts of the page at all times. The logo is placed on the left-hand side and links back to the top of the page. The navigation links on the right hand side link to different sections on this one page website. Smooth scrolling was introduced via CSS to ensure a good user experience. In small devices, a hamburger menu icon (familiar to users of mobile devices) contains the navigation links and drops down when pressed. 

Two call to actions are placed at the top of the page in line with the user stories to encourage users to book an appointment using the “Book” link or to phone using the uniquely placed phone number. I really wanted the phone number to be upfront and visible at all times and although this may break slightly from convention, it was designed this way to be central, visible and interactive (click to call on mobile devices).

The logo reduces in size as you hover over it to indicate that is clickable.

## Hero Image

![The hero image for the website](/assets/images/hero-image-screenshot.webp "Hero Image")

The photo of the dog is also used as their facebook profile image so this linked their brands together. The hero image gradually increases in size on page loading to attract and engage users, while the text clearly states the purpose of the website and encourages the user to contact the company. On small devices, the text is stacked on top of the hero image to ensure compatibility with devices that have smaller widths and the hero image and text automatically resize for each device width.

Services Section

![The services section of the website](/assets/images/services-section-screenshot.webp "Services Section")

Originally gold text color on a white background, this was changed to black text on a white background to increase contrast and make the site more accessible. It lists a range of services and succinctly describes each one to assure the user of what the company does and what is available. Icons were used to attract the users eyes and allow them to quickly understand what type of service was being offered. On smaller devices, the services stack delightfully one on top of the other.

Gallery Section

![The gallery section of the website](/assets/images/gallery-section-screenshot.webp "Gallery Section")

The beautifully designed bootstrap gallery was used here to attractively display previous clients and showcase how talented the groomers are. The imagery provided by the owners really adds a feel for the groomers shop so that users know what type of atmosphere to expect when they arrive. Each image is shown on a different line on mobile devices so it was decided to reduce the number displayed on these devices to give the user a more positive experience and to avoid scroll boredom setting in. 

Testimonials Section

![The testimonial section of the website](/assets/images/testimonials-section-screenshot.webp "Testimonial Section")

In line with the user stories section, it was felt important to assure potential clients that their pooch would be in good hands and the testimonials section really lent a hand to this. Showcasing the groomed dog, personalising it with their name and then adding the lovely comments that clients had made creates a warm feeling for users and increasing the ability to trust the company. Again, on smaller devices, the testimonials stack one on top of the other for ease of scrolling. It is worth noting that each section of the website starts with the same header - i.e. a title and then a small description, this helps the user learn that they have entered a new section and added familiarity and ease of learning to the site.

Book an Appointment Section

![The book an appointment section of the website](/assets/images/book-section-screenshot.webp "Book an appointment Section")

Users are encouraged to book an appointment either by phoning the groomers directly (the phone number was highlighted in white to draw user attention to it and make it easy to find) or by filling in a short form if messaging is preferred. On smaller devices the form inputs stack on top of each other for ease of filling in.

Name, phone number and email address are required so that contact with the user can be made. So as not to put off the user, dogs breed and filling in a message was not required as long as contact can be made. 


Footer

![The footer section of the website](/assets/images/footer-section-screenshot.webp "Footer Section")

The footer matches the header in reverse with the gold bar once again featuring call to actions to encourage the user to interact with and find out more via social media.

The footer then incorporates useful information including opening times, the shop location and contact information and on smaller devices they change from three separate columns to filling the width of the device and therefore they stack one on top of the other.
