## Design 

### Colour
The colour palette was taken from the branding already used by this well established company. This was to ensure brand continuity throughout all there digital as well as tangible marketing assets.

* Gold: #ba9950
* White #fff
* Black #000

The dark version of bootstrap was used.

### Typography
The Poppins font is the main font used throughout the site. It is used frequently by many web developers and is easy on the eye. Sans Serif is set as a backup should the Poppins font fail to load.

### Structure
The page is structured in a familiar, user friendly, and easy to learn way. The navigation bar with the shop logo on the left side and the navigation links to the right is a view that users are used to and link to the different sections of the webpage.  The website consists of four sections :
* A home section with a hero image and small description of the business. 
* A section detailing the services offered
* A gallery section with images of previously groomed dogs
* A testimonial section from happy customers
* A footer section containing contact information, opening times and social media links
